Hi,

You are in possession of a sample of code written as an assignment for Numerical Computing II at Kent State University in Spring of 2018 under the instruction of Dr. Xiaoyu Zheng. These files are for inspiration only. Not that you'd want to, because it's mostly spaghetti, but direct copying is a violation of Galactic Protocols. You do so at your own risk.

The assignment file and lecture notes are included in this package. If you've found this file, please add the date and time at which you're reading this, and save it before you send it off to the next reader.
