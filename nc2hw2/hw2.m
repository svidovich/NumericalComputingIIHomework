%   Problem 1   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Write a matlab function that returns function value, derivative value,
% and second derivative value at a point.
% This function can be found in h2p1ret.m.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Problem 2   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Draw the curve exp(2*sin(x))-x over I = [-5,11], and apply the matlab
% function fminbnd to it.
% The code for this problem can be found in h2p2.m.
h2p2

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Problem 3   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Implement Newton's Iteration on the function. Mark the solution point
% acquired from this algorithm on the graph.
% Use initial guess x0 = 3. Also, check the rate of convergence.
% The code for Newton's iteration can be found in h2p3ret.m.

%   Problem 4   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Implement GCNM on the function. Mark the solution point
% acquired from this algorithm on the graph.
% Use initial guess x0 = 3. Also, check the rate of convergence.
% The code for GCNM can be found in h2p4ret.m.
